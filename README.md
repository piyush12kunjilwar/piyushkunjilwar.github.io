I'm a Software Engineer with experience at Accenture and General Motors, specializing in full-stack development and cloud computing. Currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems at Northeastern University.

I've successfully optimized system performance through microservices architecture, reducing latency by 35% and improving system uptime to 99.9%. My work with cloud technologies like AWS and GCP has helped reduce infrastructure costs while scaling applications to support millions of users.

I'm passionate about building scalable solutions and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
